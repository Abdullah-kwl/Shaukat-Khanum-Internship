The treatment plan is designed to address the specific symptoms and promote a quick recovery. It involves a combination of therapeutic exercises, pain management strategies, and lifestyle modifications.\n",
    "    The patient is prescribed a tailored exercise routine focusing on stretching and strengthening the affected muscles and joints. This regimen should be performed under the guidance of a qualified physiotherapist or healthcare professional. The patient is advised to follow the exercise plan diligently to enhance flexibility and alleviate discomfort.\n",
    "    In addition to the exercise routine, pain management strategies are integrated into the treatment plan. This includes the use of over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, as needed for pain control. It is crucial for the patient to adhere to the recommended dosage and consult with a healthcare professional before taking any new medications, especially if there are pre-existing medical conditions or allergies.\n",

    "Follow-up Recommendations:\n",
    "    Regular follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. The first follow-up is recommended after two weeks from the initiation of the treatment plan. During this appointment, the healthcare professional will assess the patient's response to the therapeutic exercises, evaluate pain levels, and provide additional guidance.\n",
    "    Subsequent follow-ups will be scheduled at monthly intervals to track long-term progress and address any emerging concerns. The patient is encouraged to communicate openly about their experiences, including any challenges or improvements observed during the course of the treatment plan.\n",
    "    In the event of persistent or worsening symptoms, the patient is advised to contact the healthcare provider promptly for a reassessment. Depending on the evaluation, modifications to the treatment plan may be made to ensure optimal recovery.\n",
